I have been awarded the [Kathryn Gillow Prize](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/postgraduate-study/graduate-prizes) for the best dissertation in my cohort of
the [MMSC](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/students/postgraduate-courses/msc-mmsc).
My dissertation was titled "_Computing Zeros and Poles of Complex Functions Numerically_"
and was supervised by [Prof. Yuji Nakatsukasa](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nakatsukasa/)
and Dr. Irwin Zaid. I hope to write this up into a publication soon.
