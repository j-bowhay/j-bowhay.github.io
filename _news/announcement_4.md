SciPy 1.15.0 has been released. There are lots of exciting new features including
[`scipy.interpolate.AAA`](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.AAA.html),
which I wrote as part of my MSc thesis. This implements the
[AAA algorithm](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/AAAfinal.pdf) for barycentric
rational approximation.
