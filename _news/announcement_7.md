I was part of the winning group at the [ICMS Modelling Camp 2025](https://www.icms.org.uk/ICMS-ModCamp25).
We worked on a project facilitated by [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/)
looking at possible improvements to the Split-Save ticket system, using a combination of
machine learning and graph theory techniques.
