I am a PhD student in the [School of Engineering Mathematics and Technology](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/science-engineering/schools/eng-maths-tech/) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), supervised by Prof. Alan Champneys and <a href='https://hennessymatt.github.io/'>Dr. Matt Hennessy</a>. My PhD research concerns how cells, which are typically created as sphere-like objects, undergo a break of symmetry where functional proteins and other organic matter are heterogeneously distributed within the cell. This process is controlled by the reaction and diffusion of small G-proteins. I aim to understand the patterns formed by the reaction-diffusion models of small G-proteins and couple them with a continuum mechanics model of cell growth to model the polarisation process. More broadly, I am interested in all things mathematical modelling; see my [CV](/cv) for more detailed research interests.

Before starting my PhD, I studied for the [MMSC](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/students/postgraduate-courses/msc-mmsc)
at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), during which I studied a wide range of courses in mathematical modelling
and numerical analysis. My dissertation was on the application of rational approximation (the [AAA algorithm](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/AAAfinal.pdf)) to pole and zero finding. When I am not working on my PhD, this is still a topic of interest.

From a young age, I have enjoyed programming and mucking around with computers. This has turned out to be a very useful skill
due to the prevalence of numerical methods in applied mathematics. Most of my work is in Python, however, I am enjoying learning
more about [Julia](https://julialang.org/). I am a maintainer of [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) (see my [open source](/os) work)
and am interested in numerical methods and their implementation. Occasionally, I dabble in numerical analysis.

Outside of academia, I enjoy sailing, cycling, and the outdoors in general.

I am keen to explore new collaborations and I enjoy working on a wide range of problems, so please feel free to get in touch.
