I am interested in solving problems that arise from industry and have worked with a wide
range of companies both individually and as part of a team:

- [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/) - The Trainline offers its customers
  "split tickets", which involves buying two separate tickets via an intermediary station rather
  than purchasing a direct ticket. This can often save the consumer a significant amount
  of money. We developed a new technique for solving this problem using machine learning-based
  pricing models and a hop-constrained shortest path solver.

    </div>

- [CFMS](https://cfms.org.uk/) - I implemented a FEM solver for modelling the
  flow of resin in carbon fibre. I also researched stabilisation techniques for hyperbolic
  problems.

- [Sagnetia Innovation](https://www.sagentiainnovation.com/) - We developed a
  network-based model of effective conductivity in polycrystalline structures.

- [DSTL](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory) -
  We researched methods for detecting ocean eddy currents in seawater velocity data.

- [CFMS](https://cfms.org.uk/) - I developed a model of a HPC data center cooling system.
