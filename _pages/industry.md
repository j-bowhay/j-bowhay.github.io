I am interested in using maths to solve problems that arise in industry and have worked
with a wide range of companies, both individually and as part of a team:

- [Paebbl](https://paebbl.com/) - Paebbl is interested in using concrete to store carbon
  dioxide and is currently developing a process to do this. This process involves
  pumping olivine mixed with water through a series of long pipes. Currently,
  these pipes are susceptible to clogging, which meaning the reactor must be shut
  down. We developed a mathematical model to understand the clogging of these pipes
  so that the mechanism for clogging can be better understood and minimised in
  future designs of the reactor.

    </div>

- [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/) - The Trainline offers its customers
  "split tickets", which involves buying two separate tickets via an intermediary station rather
  than purchasing a direct ticket. This can often save the consumer a significant amount
  of money. We developed a new technique for solving this problem using machine learning-based
  pricing models and a hop-constrained shortest path solver.

    </div>

- [CFMS](https://cfms.org.uk/) - I implemented a FEM solver for modelling the
  flow of resin in carbon fibre. I also researched stabilisation techniques for hyperbolic
  problems.

    </div>

- [Sagnetia Innovation](https://www.sagentiainnovation.com/) - We developed a
  network-based model to compute the effective conductivity of polycrystalline structures.

- [DSTL](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory) -
  We researched methods for detecting ocean eddy currents in seawater velocity data.

- [CFMS](https://cfms.org.uk/) - I developed a mathematical model of a HPC data center cooling system.
